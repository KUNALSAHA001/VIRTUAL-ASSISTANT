      "questions": "what is the distant of moon from earth",
      "answer": "The average distance between the Moon and Earth is 238,900 miles (384,400 kilometers). This distance varies because the Moon's orbit around Earth is not a perfect circle. The Moon's closest approach to Earth is called perigee, and its farthest distance is called apogee. The Moon's perigee distance is 225,622 miles (363,304 kilometers), and its apogee distance is 252,088 miles (405,504 kilometers).\r\n\r\nThe Moon's orbit around Earth takes 27.3 days to complete. The Moon's rotation on its axis also takes 27.3 days, which is why we always see the same side of the Moon from Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is the fifth largest moon in the Solar System. It is the largest moon relative to the size of its planet in the Solar System. The Moon is thought to have formed about 4.51 billion years ago, not long after Earth. The most widely accepted explanation is that the Moon formed from the debris left over after a giant impact between Earth and a Mars-sized body called Theia.\r\n\r\nThe Moon has a significant effect on Earth. It stabilizes Earth's orbit and helps to moderate Earth's climate. The Moon's gravity also causes the tides on Earth.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is a fascinating and important part of our solar system. It is a beautiful object to look at, and it has a profound effect on Earth."

      "questions": "name me some protein rich foods.",
      "answer": "Here are some protein rich foods:\n\n* Meat: Chicken, beef, pork, lamb, fish, seafood\n* Eggs: Whole eggs are a great source of protein and other nutrients.\n* Dairy: Milk, cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese\n* Beans and legumes: Lentils, beans, chickpeas, peanuts, soybeans\n* Nuts and seeds: Almonds, walnuts, peanuts, chia seeds, flax seeds\n* Whole grains: Quinoa, brown rice, oats, barley\n* Vegetables: Broccoli, spinach, kale, Brussels sprouts\n* Fruits: Avocado, berries, bananas, apples\n* Protein powders: Whey protein, casein protein, egg protein\n\nIt is important to note that the amount of protein in a food can vary depending on the serving size. For example, a 3-ounce serving of chicken breast contains about 27 grams of protein, while a 1-cup serving of black beans contains about 7 grams of protein.\n\nIt is also important to note that the quality of protein can vary depending on the food. Animal-based proteins, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy, are considered to be complete proteins, meaning they contain all nine essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own. Plant-based proteins, such as beans, legumes, nuts, and seeds, are considered to be incomplete proteins, meaning they do not contain all nine essential amino acids. However, it is possible to combine different plant-based proteins to create a complete protein. For example, a meal that includes rice and beans would provide all nine essential amino acids.\n\nThe recommended daily intake of protein for adults is 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight. However, athletes and people who are trying to build muscle may need to consume more protein. It is important to talk to a registered dietitian or other qualified healthcare professional to determine how much protein you need."

      "questions": "what is pluto",
      "answer": "Pluto is a dwarf planet in the Kuiper belt, located in the outermost region of the Solar System. It was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh and was originally classified as the ninth planet from the Sun. However, in 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) reclassified Pluto as a dwarf planet because it did not meet the IAU's definition of a planet.\n\nPluto is about two-thirds the size of the Moon and has a diameter of about 2,370 kilometers. It is made up of mostly ice and rock, and has a very thin atmosphere. Pluto has five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos, and Styx. Charon is the largest moon and is about half the size of Pluto.\n\nPluto's orbit is very elliptical and takes 248 Earth years to complete. It is also tilted at an angle of 17 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. This means that Pluto can sometimes be closer to the Sun than Neptune.\n\nPluto was once considered the ninth planet from the Sun, but it was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. This was because the IAU defined a planet as a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto does not meet the third criterion, as it shares its orbit with many other objects in the Kuiper belt.\n\nPluto is a very interesting and unique object in the Solar System. It is the only dwarf planet that has been visited by a spacecraft, the New Horizons spacecraft in 2015. New Horizons provided us with stunning images of Pluto and its moons, and helped us to learn more about this distant world."
